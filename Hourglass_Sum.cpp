#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

	/*
	 * You are given a 2D array with dimensions 6*6. An hourglass
	 * in an array is defined as a portion shaped like this:
	 *
	 *    a b c
	 *      d
	 *    e f g
	 *
	 * For example, if we create an hourglass using the number 1
	 * within an array full of zeros, it may look like this:
	 *
	 *    1 1 1 0 0 0
	 *    0 1 0 0 0 0
	 *    1 1 1 0 0 0
	 *    0 0 2 4 4 0
	 *    0 0 0 2 0 0
	 *    0 0 1 2 4 0
     *
     * Note that there are many hourglasses in the array, for ex:
     *
     *    1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0     2 4 4
  	 * 	    1         0         0         2
	 *	  1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0     1 2 4
	 *
	 * For which the first three are formed in the first row.
	 *
	 * Output:
	 *     Print the largest sum among all the hourglasses in the
	 *     array.
	 *
	 *     With given input above, output will be:
	 *         19
