	 * Determine 1). if the rectangles overlap, and
	 * 			 2). if 1). is true, what percent of the first rectangle is overlapped
	 *
	 * For example:
	 *     Input string: "(1,1),(4,4),(4,1),(1,4),(4,2),(3,2),(4,1),(3,1)" (coordinates are
	 *     				 in no order except for first four = 1st rectangle, ... etc)
	 *
	 *         Visualized: (Rect 1 = Big one, Rect 2 = Small one)
	 *					    
	 *         			 4 |-----|
	 *         			 3 |     |
	 *         			 2 |    _|
	 *         			 1 |___|_|
	 *         			   1 2 3 4
	 *     Output:
	 *     		1). Yes
	 *     		2). 1/9 = 11% overlapped
