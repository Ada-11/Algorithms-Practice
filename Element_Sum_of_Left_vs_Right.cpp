	/*
	 * Determine if there is an element in the array such that the
	 * sum of the elements on the left == sum of the elements on 
	 * the right.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *     Input: 2        //Number of test cases
	 *            3        //Length of following case
	 *            1 2 3    //Test case
	 *            4
	 *            1 2 3 3
	 *     Output: NO
	 *             YES
	 *     Explanation:
	 *             Case 1: No such element
	 *             Case 2: [2], because (left) 1 + 2 == (right) 3
	 *
